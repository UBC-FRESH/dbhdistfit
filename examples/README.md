# Examples

Example artefacts will land here as the package matures:

- `notebooks/` — reproducible Jupyter notebooks demoing HPS and censored workflows.
- `python/` — small, automatable Python scripts.
- `cli/` — bash one-liners using the Typer CLI.

Datasets referenced by the examples will be managed through a DataLad submodule once
representative tallies are published.
