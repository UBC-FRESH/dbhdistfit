# Overview

`dbhdistfit` streamlines fitting probability density functions to diameter-at-breast-height (DBH)
inventories. The package packages workflows for:

- horizontal point sampling (HPS) tallies with size-bias corrections handled through weighting, and
- fixed-area inventories where left/right censoring implies truncated support.

The project grew out of research reproducibility stacks in the UBC FRESH Lab, and is now being
generalised into a reusable toolkit with Python, CLI, and R interfaces.
