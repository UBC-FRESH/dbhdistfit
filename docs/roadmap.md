# Readiness Roadmap

The canonical roadmap lives at `{doc}`ROADMAP.md`. It is mirrored here for convenience once the
documentation build pipeline is wired to sync top-level planning artefacts.

```{warning}
This page is a placeholder and will be replaced with an automated include of the repository
roadmap once the docs build pipeline is finalised.
```
