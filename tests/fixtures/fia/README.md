# FIA Fixture Snapshot

This directory stores trimmed FIA CSV extracts used in tests. Source tables
were downloaded from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Datamart on
2025-11-07 (Hawaii dataset). Only a handful of rows were retained to keep the
fixture lightweight.

Files:
- `tree_small.csv`
- `cond_small.csv`
- `plot_small.csv`

The data are in the public domain (USDA FIA). See
